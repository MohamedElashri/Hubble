# Hubble Constant
Estimating the Age of universe using galaxies distance and velocity data and calculating the Hubble constant. 

In this project I am trying to select my galaxies data and then try to fit the linear model from Hubble relation to get and estimation for the age of universe. 

This analysis is an extension of the [zonination](https://github.com/zonination/galaxies) analysis which was carried in R and I applied their code implementation for my data selection. This is avialable inside [R Analysis](https://github.com/MohamedElashri/Hubble/tree/main/R%20Analysis) Folder

My main implementation is a python and I relied about estimating Hubble constant first then relied on the fact the age of universe is reciprocal of Hubble constant.

Main plort is

**Hint**: Age of the universe is not 1/H_0 but there should be some correction factor that account for relative abundance of dark energy/(dark) matter/radiation and it is close of 1 which why we use this assumption. 


The python implementation is available inside the Jupyter notebook [here](https://github.com/MohamedElashri/Hubble/blob/main/Age_of_the_Universie_.ipynb)
